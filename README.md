# SpyParty-Stats-Analyzer
Takes in the name of either a single player or two opponents alongside a folder of replays and analyzes their statistics for win rate, mission completion, etc on every venue.

**All credit for the SpyParty parser and files within the *spyparty* directory are to LtHummus, I simply included the library to easily keep it in the same place as all the other files.  
The parser is used to retrieve game data from the replay files, however the collect.py file doing the statistical work was my work.**
